# Deployment

## Status

Prototype / In Development

There may not be a deployable application yet. Do not publish fake deployment claims.

## Future Deployment Requirements

- Runtime and package manager versions.
- Exact install, development, test, build, and start commands.
- Required environment variables from `.env.example`.
- Hosting platform configuration.
- Database migration or rules deployment process, if applicable.
- Monitoring, rollback, and incident response notes.

## Environment Strategy

- `development` for local work.
- `preview` for pull requests and demos.
- `production` only after security, testing, and operational readiness reviews.

## Planned MVP Deployment

The initial deployment target is a prototype capable of:

* Receiving WhatsApp webhook events.
* Running lead qualification workflows.
* Applying human handoff rules.
* Storing qualified lead information.

Deployment instructions should only be documented once a runnable implementation and verified setup process exist.
